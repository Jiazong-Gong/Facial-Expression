# There are several scripts for this classification task.

## Classifier.py is modified based on the code from Lab2 in COMP4660.

## Logger.py is referred to https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/04-utils/tensorboard

# Running and testing

## Split.py is just for previous testing purpose

## If it is for one time evaluation, one can simply run Classifier.py with appropriate parameters accordingly.

## The default setting in Classifier.py is for FNN with PCA.

## If it is for multiple running tests, one can open the Jupyter Notebook Tuning and testing

# Since CUDA may not be suitable for small tasks, no CUDA is required. 

# Requirements:
	PyTorch 1.4.0
	TensorFlow 1.15.0
	TensorBoard 1.15.0
